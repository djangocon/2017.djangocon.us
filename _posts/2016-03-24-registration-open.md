Registration is open! You may book your tickets and reserve your hotel
accommodations for DjangoCon US 2016 now!

We've worked hard to make tickets [as cheap as they've never been
before](https://2016.djangocon.us/blog/2016/03/18/what-difference-year-makes/)
this year, and thus have low prices for students and individuals. [Financial
assistance](https://2016.djangocon.us/financialaid/) is also available to
those with limited budgets.

Register for Djangocon US 2016 [here](https://defna.ticketbud.com/djangocon-
us-2016). Please don't wait too long! We're fairly confident that we'll sell
out again this year.

[Reserve your hotel
accommodation](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/Book/django) to take advantage
of our discounted room rates. This year the daily room rate for single or
double occupancy is $199. This rate is available until June 15th, subject to
availability.

We look forward to seeing you in Philly this summer!
