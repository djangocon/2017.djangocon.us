Do you love the Django community and want to know about an easy way to help
out with DjangoCon US this year?

The DjangoCon US organizers are looking for volunteers to review talk and
tutorial submissions. This will require a small but substantial time
commitment on your part from now until roughly the beginning of May.

If you're interested in joining the review committee, please [drop us a
line](https://2016.djangocon.us/cdn-cgi/l/email-
protection#2b434e4747446b4f414a454c44484445055e58). We appreciate your help!
