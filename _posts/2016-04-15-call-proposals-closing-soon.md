We want to hear about your experience with and around Django. However, talks:

  * Don't need to be about Django specifically
  * Don't need to be 100% fleshed out
  * Don't need to be purely technical
  * Don't need to be advanced

The conference isn't until July, so if you have a kernel of an idea, please
submit it!

You've never spoken before? Not a problem! There are speaker mentors that will
help you.

Is cost a concern? Not a problem! [Apply for financial
aid](https://2016.djangocon.us/financialaid/) (deadline is April 25th).

There is no reason not to apply! Here are two articles to get you started:

As always, feel free to [contact us](https://2016.djangocon.us/cdn-cgi/l
/email-protection#046c6168686b44606e656a636b676b6a2a7177)!

Don't wait and submit your proposals soon! We hope to see you at DjangoCon US
in Philly!
