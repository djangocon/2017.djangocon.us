title: "Last Call For Proposals"
---

We are down to our last call for talk and tutorial submissions for DjangoCon
US this year!

If you have a talk or tutorial idea we encourage you to [submit it
today](https://2016.djangocon.us/speaking/) before it's too late. We will not
extend the deadline this year.

We will accept submissions until midnight Anywhere on Earth today (April 18th)
so don't wait any longer and submit your proposal now! ;)

Even though our CFP is closed now, there are still many ways to participate.
How about working on a short 5-minute lightning talk for example? ;)

We look forward to seeing you in Philly this summer!
