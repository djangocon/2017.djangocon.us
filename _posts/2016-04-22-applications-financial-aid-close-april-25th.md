title: "Applications for  Financial Aid Close April 25th!"
---
This is your friendly reminder that our [financial aid
application](http://goo.gl/forms/XvYBg4d8o7) closes on April 25th. We'll let
you know by May 6th if your application for aid has been accepted. Be sure to
get your application in ASAP!

We've had some questions from people who don't feel like they are the type of
person we're looking for, but they still need financial help to attend
DjangoCon US. Let us reassure you: we're not looking to give any particular
person funding! If you're a member of an underrepresented group (whatever that
means to you), if you have a lower income, or if your circumstances at this
moment mean you need help to come to DjangoCon US, we want you to apply. You
can ask for all or part of your costs to cover transportation, registration,
or lodging. If you're not sure whether or not you should apply for financial
aid... the answer is, yes, if you need aid, you should apply!
