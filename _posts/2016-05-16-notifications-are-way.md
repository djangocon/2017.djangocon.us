title: "Notifications are on the way!"

You'll know about your talk or tutorial submission, and your financial aid
applications, by the end of the week!

First off, thank you all for applying to speak and teach at DjangoCon US, and
for applying for financial aid to get you to the conference!

Our ponies are taking a little longer to get in the stable than we
anticipated. We're going to start sending out notifications today, and
everyone will know about their application by the end of the week.

If you haven't received an email from us yet, that does not mean your talk,
tutorial, or financial aid application was rejected!

We're really sorry for the delay. We know you're anxious to know about your
applications, and we are working hard to make that happen. We had a record
number of talk and tutorial submissions and financial aid applications this
year, so thanks for being patient with us!
