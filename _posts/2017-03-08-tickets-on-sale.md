We have tiered pricing, so please read through and pick the best one for you. If you need assistance with travel, accommodation expenses, and/or a conference ticket then please [apply for financial aid](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAv0EiZlrNISofSaZNyf7INq86Ayka8ZV_aEWHr97ptUP26A/viewform?c=0&w=1) by April 10, 2017.

You can also donate  to our financial aid program when you purchase your tickets. The more donations we receive, the more student tickets and financial aid we can make available to attendees.

We have 50 corporate tickets and 50 individual tickets on sale at the early bird rate. After those are sold out, only regular-priced tickets will be available.

Student/Diversity pricing will not change.

## Ticket prices

**Individual ($345 early bird, $445 regular)**: If your company has 5 or fewer employees, or if you’re purchasing your own ticket without any help from your employer.

**Corporate ($545 early bird, $645 regular)**: If your employer (with more than 5 employees) is paying for your ticket. State or government institutions should use the corporate rate if they are able.

**Student/Diversity ($245)**: If you’re unemployed, on a lower income, are a member of an underrepresented group, or would benefit from a lower-priced ticket for another reason.

**Tutorials ($150)**: Not on sale yet because they haven’t been selected! They are a separate cost from your conference ticket. You can register for a tutorial without registering for the conference itself. You must register for a specific tutorial.

**Sprints (free)**: The ticket is free, but we ask you to register so we can buy you lunch. You do not have to register for the conference itself to register for sprints.
