title: "How To Choose a Job in the Tech Industry"
---

Naturally, we still have to apply, interview, have the right skills and
get the job. However, because our skills are in high demand, there's a
plethora of jobs out there from which we can choose and employers are
frequently vying to recruit us to their teams.  This is not the case for
most people in most industries.

That being said, when presented with so many opportunities, how do you
choose the one that is the best fit?  Personally, I use the following
four-point framework to guide my decisions, and as a result, 
that’s how I ended up working at Rover.

**It’s all about the people**
First, the most important question is, “do I like the people?”  
To my way of thinking, I spend as much time with the people I work with
as I do with my family, so I want to enjoy my time around them.

Now, you can’t answer that question directly before you’ve even 
applied, but you can get a sense for if the company seems to have
strong values and high ethical standards.  Between press, asking around
your network via LinkedIn, reading Glassdoor reviews you can start
to get a sense for what the company’s culture.

Rover has it’s [Core Values](https://www.rover.com/core-values/) 
published on our web site, so that prospective candidates will
understand what it’s like to work here.  These values are not
platitudes--they are actual principles we use to guide our
day-to-day work.

Ultimately, the matter of people is a threshold question: 
if a company doesn’t share my values, then none of the other
questions matter.

**The “sniff test”**
The second question I ask is, “does this product or service pass
the ‘sniff test’ for me?”  When I say, “‘sniff test’ to me” that’s
actually sort of a multi-part question composed of several 
sub-questions, such as:

- Does the product make sense and do I understand what they’re doing?
- Is this solving a real problem for consumers or businesses, 
or is this a solution in search of a problem?
- Do I think it’s a noble endeavor that will make the world better?

Essentially, the question I’m asking myself is: 
“do I buy into what this company is doing?”  I want to have meaningful
work, so if I can’t buy in, then I’m not that interested.

For me, Rover answered these questions easily.  As a dog owner,
I had experienced the problem of searching for someone to care for
my pup like family while I was away, and owning a pet has enriched my
life.  Rover believes that everyone should have the opportunity to
enjoy the unconditional love of a pet, and our mission is to make dog
ownership possible.  

**Getting out of bed in the morning**
The third question I ask myself is, “will I enjoy the work?”  
I believe that we only have success when we’re having fun.  
And, at the end of the day, we all have to get out of bed in the
morning, and it’s really hard to do that when you don’t enjoy the work
you’re doing.

I’ve spent my entire career building industry leading, 
consumer websites, and that’s what we’re doing here it Rover.
Creating features for the web site and mobile apps, the machine
learning algorithms that power our custom search engine, and the data
warehouse that allows us to analyze our experiments and split tests...
I love all of these things, so I knew the job would be a fit.

**Keeping the boat afloat**
The fourth and final question I ask is about the business,
“is it viable?”  Is the business growing?  Are they profitable?
If they’re an unprofitable startup, do they have well-respected
investors?  Essentially, the questions here boil down to risk: there’s
nothing wrong with joining a company in a sub-optimal financial
position--goodness knows that I’ve joined some crazy startups in
my career!--but it’s also important to go into that eyes wide open.

Rover, of course, is not in that position: we have world-class
investors, are growing rapidly and a have bright future ahead.
