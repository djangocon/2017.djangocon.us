---

[Tito](https://ti.to/) makes simple, powerful software designed to
help with ticket sales and management for events. They mostly make it
to keep the organizers responsible for that as happy and sane as
possible.

They have three guiding lights as a company:

1. Putting experience first for their employees, their customers, and
their customersâ€™ customers â€“ ensuring that everyone who comes into
Titoâ€™s proximity enjoys their work and spare time as best they can,

2. Building a product that helps their customers to be better at what
they do,

3. Providing responsive, personal customer support.

Most recently, Tito have been silver-sponsoring DjangoCon (ðŸ˜Š), 
[hiring](https://tito.io/about), and relaunching their
[blog](http://blog.tito.io/posts). 

As luck would have it, sponsorship is the first theme theyâ€™re going for
on said new, shiny blog. Theyâ€™ve tried to be comprehensive, so there
should be a lot of material to look through.

Therein, for your entertainment and enlightenment, you could:
â€¢	Use a [custom calculator](http://downloads.tito.io/sponsorship-cost-calculator) 
to figure out how much you can legitimately ask for in sponsorship,
â€¢	Read an interview about
[finding sponsorship in the JavaScript niche](http://blog.tito.io/posts/how-to-secure-event-sponsorship),
â€¢	Or, figure out how corporate sponsorship can work for a
[creative event](http://blog.tito.io/posts/corporate-sponsorship-for-a-creative-event-can-work-0). 

Just putting it out there. 

In any case, you can find more about Tito via these links, or get in
touch if youâ€™re too curious to wait out the 1.5 seconds itâ€™ll take the
page to load. 

*Tito has been making [event software](https://ti.to/) to sell and
manage tickets for thepast 5 years because they want to make that
process as easy as humanly possible. Theyâ€™re small, self-funded and
located in Dublin, Ireland. You can track their
[progress](http://blog.tito.io/posts/topic/new-features)
and read their 
[experiences](http://blog.tito.io/posts/topic/announcements) here.*
